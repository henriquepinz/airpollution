# Air Pollution in the EU27 & UK (CO2)
This is a data visualization project about CO2 pollution. All data used was obtained through the European Comission via the Copernicus program CAMS.

### 1. Introduction
This report examines CO₂ emissions trends in the EU27 & UK from 2019 to 2024. The goal is to identify key emission sources, sectoral contributions, and correlations with economic indicators such as GDP. By understanding these patterns, we can assess the impact of policies and economic activities on emissions and explore potential strategies for reduction.
#### Scope of the Report
This analysis covers:
- Geographic Scope: EU27 countries and the UK.
- Timeframe: 2019-2024.
- Key Breakdown Factors: Emissions by country
- Emissions by economic sector
- Correlation with GDP (total and per capita).

Notable drops occurred in 2020, likely due to pandemic-related restrictions that reduced transportation and industrial activity. However, emissions rebounded in subsequent years as economies reopened.


#### Total CO₂ Emissions by Country (2019-2024)

Over the five-year period, emissions remain concentrated in a few key countries:

- Germany is the highest emitter, with 3,757 MtCO₂, largely due to its industrial base and reliance on coal and natural gas.
- The United Kingdom (2,101 MtCO₂), Italy (1,875 MtCO₂), and Poland (1,816 MtCO₂) follow closely.
- France (1,774 MtCO₂), despite having a strong nuclear energy sector, still contributes significantly.
- Spain (1,437 MtCO₂) and the Netherlands (857 MtCO₂) round out the top contributors.

This distribution highlights the importance of targeted strategies in high-emission countries, particularly in energy and transportation sectors.

### 3. Economic Correlation with CO₂ Emissions

#### Total CO₂ Emissions by Sector (2019-2024)
Examining emissions by sector:

Ground Transport: The largest contributor, due to reliance on gasoline and diesel vehicles. Electrification of transport and improved public transit could help reduce this footprint.

Power: Emissions from electricity generation remain high, though transitioning to renewable energy sources could mitigate this.

- Aviation:
  International flights: Despite its lower total share, aviation is a high-emission activity per passenger.
  Domestic flights: Contribute less but remain relevant, especially in larger countries.

#### Monthly CO₂ Emission Trends per Sector
Looking at monthly emission patterns, we observe:

- Residential sector peaks in winter due to increased heating demand.
- Ground Transport emissions rise in summer with increased travel.
- International Aviation emissions dropped significantly in 2020, reflecting the pandemic’s impact but rebounded afterward.


#### 4. Economic Correlation with CO₂ Emissions
##### Total Emissions vs. Total GDP
A common assumption is that wealthier countries emit more CO₂ due to higher industrial activity and energy consumption. However, this relationship is complex:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/587dcd1b-04f0-4dbc-8a10-752d4a367052" height="400" width="">

- Some high-GDP countries (e.g., Germany, UK, France) have high emissions, but their emissions per GDP unit are lower compared to some smaller economies.
- Certain countries have high emissions despite lower GDP, indicating inefficient energy use or reliance on fossil fuels.

##### CO₂ Emissions per GDP per Capita:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4396ea25-fd24-44c2-9186-4267796eebd4" height="400" width="">

- Countries with lower emissions per GDP unit (e.g., France) often have cleaner energy sources (e.g., nuclear power).
- Countries with high emissions per capita but lower GDP (e.g., Poland, Czech Republic) may rely more on fossil fuel-based industries.
- This analysis suggests that economic growth does not necessarily mean higher emissions. Investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency can help sustain GDP growth while reducing   CO₂ emissions.

#### 5. Key Insights & Discussion
Emissions appear to be stabilizing or slightly decreasing in many countries, indicating that ongoing efforts to reduce CO₂ output are starting to show results. Additionally, economic growth is increasingly decoupled from emissions, suggesting that clean energy adoption and efficiency improvements are making a tangible impact. Some countries are progressing faster than others by prioritizing renewable energy, electrification, and energy efficiency programs, demonstrating that proactive policies can lead to meaningful reductions in pollution.  

However, several challenges remain. A heavy reliance on fossil fuels in countries like Poland and the Czech Republic continues to drive high emissions, making the energy transition more complex. Transport emissions also remain a significant challenge, requiring accelerated adoption of electric vehicles and the development of supporting infrastructure to curb reliance on gasoline and diesel-powered transportation. Furthermore, policy inconsistencies between EU nations could slow collective progress toward net-zero goals, as varying levels of commitment and regulatory frameworks create disparities in emissions reduction efforts.  

To continue making progress, it is essential to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy while ensuring grid stability to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. Electrification in both transportation and industry must also be a priority, as these sectors contribute heavily to emissions and have significant potential for cleaner alternatives. Implementing strong energy efficiency policies is another crucial step, as reducing energy waste provides a quick and effective way to cut emissions. Finally, it is imperative to ensure that economic growth remains decoupled from emissions, reinforcing the idea that industrial and technological advancements do not have to come at the expense of environmental sustainability.  

With the right mix of policies, investments, and technological advancements, the EU27 and the UK can continue reducing emissions while maintaining economic stability. The coming years will be critical in determining whether these regions can successfully transition toward a low-carbon future, balancing economic progress with environmental responsibility.
