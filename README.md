# Air Pollution in the EU27 & UK (CO2)
This is a data visualization project about CO2 pollution. All data used was obtained through the European Comission via the Copernicus program CAMS.

### 1. Introduction
This report examines CO₂ emissions trends in the EU27 & UK from 2019 to 2024. The goal is to identify key emission sources, sectoral contributions, and correlations with economic indicators such as GDP. By understanding these patterns, we can assess the impact of policies and economic activities on emissions and explore potential strategies for reduction.
#### Scope of the Report
This analysis covers:
- Geographic Scope: EU27 countries and the UK.
- Timeframe: 2019-2024.
- Key Breakdown Factors: Emissions by country
- Emissions by economic sector
- Correlation with GDP (total and per capita).

Notable drops occurred in 2020, likely due to pandemic-related restrictions that reduced transportation and industrial activity. However, emissions rebounded in subsequent years as economies reopened.


#### Total CO₂ Emissions by Country (2019-2024)

Over the five-year period, emissions remain concentrated in a few key countries:

- Germany is the highest emitter, with 3,757 MtCO₂, largely due to its industrial base and reliance on coal and natural gas.
- The United Kingdom (2,101 MtCO₂), Italy (1,875 MtCO₂), and Poland (1,816 MtCO₂) follow closely.
- France (1,774 MtCO₂), despite having a strong nuclear energy sector, still contributes significantly.
- Spain (1,437 MtCO₂) and the Netherlands (857 MtCO₂) round out the top contributors.

This distribution highlights the importance of targeted strategies in high-emission countries, particularly in energy and transportation sectors.

### 3. Economic Correlation with CO₂ Emissions

#### Total CO₂ Emissions by Sector (2019-2024)
Examining emissions by sector:

Ground Transport: The largest contributor, due to reliance on gasoline and diesel vehicles. Electrification of transport and improved public transit could help reduce this footprint.

Power: Emissions from electricity generation remain high, though transitioning to renewable energy sources could mitigate this.

Industry: Manufacturing, construction, and industrial processes contribute significantly. Adoption of cleaner technologies and carbon capture methods could improve efficiency.

Residential: Household heating and electricity consumption play a major role, particularly in colder regions. Energy-efficient housing and renewable heating solutions are crucial.

- Aviation:
  International flights: Despite its lower total share, aviation is a high-emission activity per passenger.
  Domestic flights: Contribute less but remain relevant, especially in larger countries.

#### Monthly CO₂ Emission Trends per Sector
Looking at monthly emission patterns, we observe:

- Residential sector peaks in winter due to increased heating demand.
- Ground Transport emissions rise in summer with increased travel.
- International Aviation emissions dropped significantly in 2020, reflecting the pandemic’s impact but rebounded afterward.


#### 4. Economic Correlation with CO₂ Emissions
##### Total Emissions vs. Total GDP
A common assumption is that wealthier countries emit more CO₂ due to higher industrial activity and energy consumption. However, this relationship is complex:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/587dcd1b-04f0-4dbc-8a10-752d4a367052" height="400" width="">

- Some high-GDP countries (e.g., Germany, UK, France) have high emissions, but their emissions per GDP unit are lower compared to some smaller economies.
- Certain countries have high emissions despite lower GDP, indicating inefficient energy use or reliance on fossil fuels.

##### CO₂ Emissions per GDP per Capita:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4396ea25-fd24-44c2-9186-4267796eebd4" height="400" width="">

- Countries with lower emissions per GDP unit (e.g., France) often have cleaner energy sources (e.g., nuclear power).
- Countries with high emissions per capita but lower GDP (e.g., Poland, Czech Republic) may rely more on fossil fuel-based industries.
- This analysis suggests that economic growth does not necessarily mean higher emissions. Investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency can help sustain GDP growth while reducing   CO₂ emissions.

#### 5. Key Insights & Discussion
Overall Emission Trends
Emissions have declined in some countries over the years, especially in 2023-2024, indicating some progress in decarbonization. However, major economies like Germany, Italy, and Poland remain key emitters, requiring stronger climate policies.

##### Economic Influence on CO₂ Emissions
Wealthier nations tend to have more efficient emissions per GDP, showing that economic growth can be decoupled from CO₂ increases.
Countries with high per-capita emissions but lower GDP should focus on cleaner energy transitions.

##### Policy & Industry Implications
Power & Transport Sectors Are Priorities: Policies promoting renewable energy and EV adoption can significantly reduce emissions. Efficiency Improvements Matter, industrial and residential energy efficiency programs can further reduce CO₂ footprints. Seasonal strategies are needed, inter energy demand spikes and summer travel peaks must be managed effectively.
